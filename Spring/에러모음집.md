## Amazon Linux에서 Build 오류 - JVM 메모리 부족

```s
  1 #
  2 # There is insufficient memory for the Java Runtime Environment to continue.
  3 # Native memory allocation (mmap) failed to map 262144 bytes for committing reserved memory.
  4 # Possible reasons:
  5 #   The system is out of physical RAM or swap space
  6 #   The process is running with CompressedOops enabled, and the Java Heap may be blocking the growt    h of the native heap
  7 # Possible solutions:
  8 #   Reduce memory load on the system
  9 #   Increase physical memory or swap space
 10 #   Check if swap backing store is full
 11 #   Decrease Java heap size (-Xmx/-Xms)
 12 #   Decrease number of Java threads
 13 #   Decrease Java thread stack sizes (-Xss)
 14 #   Set larger code cache with -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=
 15 #   JVM is running with Unscaled Compressed Oops mode in which the Java heap is
 16 #     placed in the first 4GB address space. The Java Heap base address is the
 17 #     maximum limit for the native heap growth. Please use -XX:HeapBaseMinAddress
 18 #     to set the Java Heap base and to place the Java Heap above 4GB virtual address.

- Increase physical memory or swap space : 메모리가 부족하니 스왑 공간을 만들어라..
